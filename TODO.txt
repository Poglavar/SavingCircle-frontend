- In the bottom left we have a box where Wallet address is displayed. Let's wire this up and make it live. On page load it should present a "Connect Wallet" button.

We'll use Rainbowkit for the wallet connectivity https://rainbowkit.com/docs/installation

- rename MNDG to CT token name

10 USDC --> remove this part
After purchase --> After registering
The "Confirm" button should initiate the sending of a blockchain transaction to the smart contract's register() function. Clicking it should pop up a wallet confirmation dialog for the transaction. While the transaction is being confirmed we gray out (disable) the modal's buttons and change "Confirm" to "Confirming..."
